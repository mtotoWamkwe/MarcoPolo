This project is a simple android application submitted in fulfilment of the application for the
Shopify Mobile Developer Intern Role for the Summer of 2018. The app uses the RecyclerView
to load images from Shopify's CDN Content Delivery Network and displays them to the user. Enabling
the user to scroll up and down inorder to see all the items. The API is provided by Shopify. You can
download the application [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.merchant.explorer.marcopolo&hl=en).
As usual any feedback is welcome. If you want to learn some programming concepts don't hesitate to reach out
and download the source code and play around with it.
